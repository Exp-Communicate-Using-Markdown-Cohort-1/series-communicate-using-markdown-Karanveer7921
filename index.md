# Learning Markdown Syntax
### Headers
There are 6 headers (h1 - h6) and are represented by using # - ######

### Images
We can add images in markdown with a link and providing an alt-text for screen readers or as a fallback in case the image fails to load.
To add image, we start with an exclamation symbol (!), followed by the alt-text in square brackets and lastly the link of image enclosed in parenthesis.

### Code Blocks
We can add code blocks in markdown by enclosing the code text in 3 backticks

```
public class MarkDown {
  public static void main(String... args) {
    System.out.println("Hello MarkDown!");
  }
}
```
